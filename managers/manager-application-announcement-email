****What is Ada Developers Academy?****
[Ada Developers Academy](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/) (Ada) is a year-long tuition-free coding school for women and gender diverse adults, with a focus on serving low income and underrepresented people, and members of the LGBTQIA+ community.

Amazon has partnered with Ada since 2014 to develop SDE interns from non-traditional backgrounds. The combination of Ada’s quality training and matching interns with Amazon’s high-caliber, inclusion-focused teams, has led to tremendous conversion success. To date, Amazon has hosted more than 100 Ada interns, and more than 80 Ada graduates are currently employed at Amazon as full-time software engineers (with many already promoted to SDEII).
