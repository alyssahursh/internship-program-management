# Alum Mentor - Intern Pairing Slack Message

**C19 Internship Supporters!** First and foremost, thank you so much for volunteering your time and experience to this cohort. It's so nice to have so many of you back for round TEN of this, and equally great to have so many new volunteers step up for the first time. We appreciate each and every one of you!

This channel includes all **Alum Mentors** and **Point Guards**. Here’s a brief description of these two roles:

* **Alum Mentors** are our first line of off-team support for interns. Mentors meet with their interns regularly to check in. If something seems wrong, mentors escalate concerns to their Point Guard for guidance.
* **Point Guards** each monitor the progress of 5 internships. They review and approve internship project plans and meet bi-weekly with the Ada program team to review the results of our program experience surveys. They’re available as a second line of off-team support, either indirectly via an alum mentor or directly with the intern if needed. They manage escalations to leadership if required. 

This [Quip document](https://quip-amazon.com/XoViAEAVeCdo/Ada-Intern-Support-Public) contains all interns, their managers and on-team mentors, alum mentors, and alum point guards. Find your intern(s) and support contacts there! Interns arrived on **Monday, 28 AUG 2023**. For more dates, see the [C18 Partner Guide](https://adadevelopers.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/#1U000000E90s/a/1U000000NNmr/tHKrfgOKR1zrgmcapWbqVAPr1IleqaIoQ.FE5WL5KOw). Both documents are bookmarked in this channel.

**Alum Mentors — Responsibilities for Week of 11 SEP 2023**

* Introduce yourself to your intern! Say hi over Slack and schedule a first 1:1 meeting for this week or early next week.
* Ensure that your intern is added to the #adies and #adies-looking-for-help Slack channels
* Determine what cadence you want to continue to meet, and set up recurring calendar invites for those future meetings. Most intern/mentor pairs meet for either 30 minutes every week or an hour every other week.
* Introduce yourself to your intern’s manager and on-team mentor using this [handy email template](https://quip-amazon.com/TDyFAZSTojB9/Alum-Mentor-ManagerMentor-Introduction-Email) (or write your own, we’re only providing a template to make your life easier).
* Send your intern’s manager, on-team mentor, and alum point guard a “meet-and-greet” calendar invite for a 15 to 30-minute introduction call. We have data that shows that when we make personal connections with managers, our interns are more likely to receive offers. 


**Alum Mentors — Future Responsibilities**

* We will be asking managers to include you in midpoint review meetings. In those meetings, we’ll be asking you to help ensure that the feedback feels valid, relevant, useful, and that the intern understands how best to use that feedback as they work towards getting an offer at the end of internship.
* You will have the opportunity to participate in the hiring decision meeting at the end of internship. Your participation can help reaffirm or refute what a manager has to say about their intern. It is rare, but not impossible, for your participation to impact the final hiring decision outcome, but only if you have evidence and data to back up your opinions.


**Point Guards — Immediate Responsibilities**

* Review the [C18 Ada Intern Project Plans](https://quip-amazon.com/dZG0OXLTlSAv) assigned to you following the [Point Guard Project Plan Verification Process](https://quip-amazon.com/tMZRAdbCtO0C). (Note that for some project plans, a tenured alum mentor may be able to help with project plan verification; see spreadsheet for additional information.) 
* Look out for meet-and-greet calendar invites from your alum mentors to meet your alum mentors, on-team mentors, and managers.


**Your support:**

* For general "How can I best support my intern" questions, ask here! We can help each other by sharing resources.
* Have you seen my [doc collection](http://www.alyssahursh.com/)? When I get the same questions more than a few times, I write a doc. Everything from how to be a star intern, to how to ask for technical help, to how to change teams after internship, to what on earth is $PATH. Many people find these docs useful!
* Esther Ng’s [Ada Alum Mentor Guide](https://quip-amazon.com/yNbKAsK8EiRL) is a great resource!
* Your alum point guard is the first person to go to if you feel like something is wrong. Your point guard can help by coaching you, or can help initiate an escalation if the situation necessitates it.
* When all else fails, DM me. If I don’t reply, DM me again. I field a lot of requests and sometimes they get missed. I never means to ignore you. Please [nohello.com](http://nohello.com/); I do not respond to “Hey, Alyssa”
* If you can no longer provide support to your intern either now or at any point in the future, please let me know! I will do my best to provide them a substitute mentor.


**Your power:**

* We are *always* just making this up as we go. We hold the power to shape this program into anything that we want it to be. 
* Just because I’ve been doing this for a long time does not mean that I am the final arbiter of how any of this works; I’m just an extraordinarily tenacious volunteer filling the gaps that I see and know how to fill.
* If you see a gap and have ideas on how to fill it, implement those ideas! Work together to make your vision happen. Do not let me be a bottleneck.
* If something happens (family emergency, health crisis, etc) and your intern needs to take a break and pause or delay their internship, we can do and have done that! If something happens and we need to move the hiring decision back to later in the internship, we can do and have done that! If something happens and we need to move an intern to a new manager, we can do and have done that! All we have to do is tell the people in power what our intern needs and then follow up until our intern’s needs are met. 
* **We have whatever power we insist that we have.**
* **I insist that we have extraordinary power.**
