## Solicit point guards 

Send out message(s) in Slack to solicit volunteers. Post to #adies and #ada-office-hours-hosts. Example message: [Intern Office Hours - Solicitation Slack Message](https://quip-amazon.com/FekzAaobaytS)

Typically we’re looking for 9 to 10 volunteers to use each volunteer every other week. You may need to post the request more than once, or reach out to individuals who could be coaxed into volunteering. We have used non-alums as hosts in the past to fill gaps.


## Create schedule

Using the results of the FieldSense survey, make the schedule. The FieldSense survey intentionally targets either 9 to 10am or 12 to 1pm PT on M, T, W, and F (9am is helpful for interns on the east coast). We only do 9am to 10am on Thursdays because of Thursdays at Ada.

[Alyssa Hursh](https://quip-amazon.com/VCU9EAD7HlZ) will always take a weekly shift, totally flexible for day/time.


## Add point guards to #ada-office-hours-hosts channel

Once you’ve sorted out the schedule, add any new hosts to #ada-office-hours-hosts


## Ask hosts to update the host wiki

Here’s that wiki: https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Ada_Developers_Academy/Intern_Office_Hours/
