# On-Team Mentor Selection


A technical mentor is *not* an “onboarding buddy,” who typically answers set-up questions for the first week or two — this is someone who will be working closely with the intern for the duration of their internship, shaping and adjusting work to match the intern’s learning curve.

Non-negotiable requirements for the on-team technical mentor:

* Available to meet with the intern daily for the full duration of internship, from 29 August 2022 to 27 January 2023 (excepting brief periods of PTO)
* Able to provide an average of 4 to 6 hours of support per week for the duration of internship (typically more at the beginning of internship and less towards the end)
* *Wants* to mentor and *has experience* mentoring junior engineers
* Has technical experience directly related to the project that you are assigning and could complete the entirety of the intern’s project themselves without additional technical support
* Has been an engineer at Amazon for at least one year (this will be verified by the Ada recruiting team)
* Has taken Making Great Hiring Decisions (MGHD) before the internship starts (prerequisite to participate in hiring decision meeting at the end of internship; this will be verified by the Ada recruiting team)


Expectations of the on-team technical mentor:

* Familiar with the [Ada Developers Academy](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/) program; aware that Ada interns have limited software experience and will need additional technical support as compared to a traditional CS intern
* Willing to pair frequently as both driver and navigator, particularly during the first 6 to 8 weeks of internship
* Provides high-quality, actionable feedback on a regular basis
* Works closely with the intern’s manager (that’s you!) and the Ada Committee to proactively identify and remediate educational gaps
* At the end of internship, provides written support for the hiring decision and attends the hiring decision meeting with the manager, Bar Raiser, and the intern’s Ada alum mentor


Additional considerations:

* Please consider potential language and communication barriers — if your intern speaks English as a second language they may have a particularly challenging time working with an engineer who also speaks English as a second language.
* **DO NOT** assign a mentor based on their gender (i.e. don’t pick a woman just because your intern is a woman).
