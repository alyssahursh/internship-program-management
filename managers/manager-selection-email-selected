# Manager Selection Email - Selected

**Subject:** [RESPONSE REQUIRED] Congratulations! You’ve been selected to host an Ada Intern!

**Body:**
Congratulations! You’ve been selected to be a **Cohort 17 Ada Intern Manager.** We're so excited for you to join this cohort. TK PICK ONE: [Your intern will be based in Seattle and will follow your team's work from home / return to office guidance. | Your intern will be fully remote for the duration of their internship.] Your intern will start on TK DATE and their internship will end on TK DATE.

To ensure the success of our interns, we hold Ada Intern Managers to a strict set of rules. We reserve the right to move your intern to a new team at any time if you do not abide by these rules. Please read the following information carefully.

* Your intern *must* report directly to you for the duration of their internship. You *must not* move the intern to another manager, even if that manager reports to you, without our express written permission. We reserve the right to refuse the move for any reason.
* If you leave Amazon or are otherwise unable to host your Ada intern for any reason before the internship start date, we will select a new manager from our manager applicant waitlist. You will not choose a replacement manager for your intern.
* If you leave Amazon, change teams, or are otherwise unable to continue hosting an Ada intern after the internship has started, you *must* notify us immediately. We reserve the right to move the intern to a new team at our sole discretion based on the best interest of the intern.
* You *must* create an [internship project plan following our written guidelines](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Ada_Developers_Academy/Intern_Program/Intern_Project_Guidelines/) and using our [project template](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Ada_Developers_Academy/Intern_Program/Internship_Projects/Project_Wiki_Template/#H3CReplaceMeWithProjectName3E) by TK DATE. The project plan will be reviewed by a calibrated reviewer before the intern starts. If you do not provide a high-quality project plan by the deadline, we reserve the right to move the intern to a new team.
* You *must* provide a highly available on-team mentor. The mentor you select must meet the following requirements:
    * Invested in the success of underrepresented interns from non-traditional backgrounds
    * At least one year of experience at Amazon
    * Has taken MGHD; eligible to participate in hiring decisions
    * Available to be shadowed and/or pair with the intern 50% of the time for the intern’s first six weeks
    * Can implement the entirety of the intern’s project without any additional guidance

Please note that we regularly survey our interns to identify if our standards are not being met, and we *will* be in contact with you if you do not abide by these rules.
