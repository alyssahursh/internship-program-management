# Intern Office Hours - Solicitation Slack Message

Hey, friends! C18 starts on Monday, which means it’s time to get the Intern Office Hours schedule sorted out. I’ve been hosting office hours for over two years; the alum community has provided daily office hours for the past two cohorts. I **love** hosting office hours. I learn something new every week. 

In a typical session, 1 to 4 interns show up and ask questions. Topics are most commonly about resolving git snafus, solving pesky build issues (aye, brazil!), understanding code review comments, and figuring out how to test changes. Office hours hosts don't always know the right answer, but I think that showing interns *how* we figure things out is more valuable than just waving a magic wand and making the problem go away. Intern office hours help fill in the gaps of on-team and alum mentorship.

As we prepare for C18, I’m looking to refresh our host list and schedule (giving some hosts a break and bringing in some fresh talent). **I'm looking for volunteers who would be willing to pick up shifts — weekly, every other week, once a month, ad-hoc, etc — from 27 FEB 2023 to 20 JUL 2023.** 

Nervous? Maybe my [Intern Office Hours Host Guide](https://quip-amazon.com/eq29ADWgML9t/Intern-Office-Hours-Host-Guide) will help put you at ease. I’ve been so impressed with our hosts, both in how they helped interns and how they helped each other when someone needed a shift covered. I bet you’d make a great host, too!
