**Recipients:** intern manager and intern on-team mentor; alum point guard on CC

**When to send:** First week of internship 

**Subject:** Ada alum mentor introductions!

**Body:**
Hi, <TK Manager, Mentor names>:

I am your Ada intern’s alum mentor. I use <TK your pronouns> pronouns. <TK - Introduce yourself, like “I am a 2020 graduate of Ada, and I’m an engineer in the Alexa org.” or whatever you want to say>.

I will be meeting with your intern on a weekly or bi-weekly basis to talk about their progress and coach them through any hurdles (technical or otherwise) that they might encounter.

I will be participating in your intern’s midpoint evaluation to help ensure that your intern receives high-quality, relevant and actionable feedback, and that they know what to focus on during the second half of internship as they work towards receiving their offer.

I will also be participating in the Bar Raiser hiring decision meeting at the end of the fourth month of internship, where I will be bringing my own data to help support the right hiring decision outcome for your intern.

I will be scheduling a quick 30 minute introduction call to say hello; look for that on your calendar!

Thanks for your commitment to [Ada’s mission](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/organization/): “We envision a world in which Black and brown women & gender expansive people achieve economic power through careers in tech.” If there’s anything I can help you with either now or in the future, feel free to reach out via email or Slack.
