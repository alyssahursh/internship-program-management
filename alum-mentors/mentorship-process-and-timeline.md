## Update  application form

We use a FieldSense survey to collect volunteer information. Make a copy of the sample form and update it to reflect any new mentor information you want to collect.

Sample application form: https://survey.fieldsense.whs.amazon.dev/survey/47aae5bb-0d60-4bc2-b564-e53893b305dc

**CHANGES FOR C20 MENTOR APPLICATION FORM:**

* Ask for mentor’s cohort (helps with distributing tenured mentors across point guards)
* Ask for time zone as single select: Eastern, Central, Mountain, Pacific, Other
* Ask for city (separate from time zone)
* Ask if mentor works in the office or is fully remote
* Ask for level
* Ask for job title




## Recruit volunteers

Send out message(s) in Slack to recruit volunteers. Example messages: [Alum Mentor Solicitation - Slack Message](https://quip-amazon.com/BXxhAEJ6DjPZ)

You may need to send out multiple messages over the course of several weeks to collect enough mentors. You might consider asking other alums to speak up and post about their positive experiences to encourage folks to volunteer. For large cohorts, you might need to ask some volunteers to take two interns, or ask alums to reach out to non-alum friends to get additional volunteers.


## Make pairings in [Ada Intern Support — Public](https://quip-amazon.com/XoViAEAVeCdo)

[Ada Intern Support — Public](https://quip-amazon.com/XoViAEAVeCdo) should contain completed columns for Project Language(s) and Project Tools, as well as blank columns for Ada Alum Mentor and Ada Alum Alias.

Use the information collected from mentors in the FieldSense survey to match interns and mentors by language and tools. It’s not possible to get everyone a perfect match; just do your best to optimize pairings where possible. If an alum left a longform answer about their mentorship assignment preferences, do what you can to honor that request. If they asked a question that warrants a response, respond via Slack. Timebox your process to 30 minutes. If you feel overwhelmed, assign alphabetically. 



## Make Slack channel

* Make a new **private** Slack channel using the format #ada-cXX-mentors
* Add the channel to all Amazon workspaces so that you can invite mentors from all Amazon organizations
* Add all mentors, point guards (from the [Ada Intern Support — Public](https://quip-amazon.com/XoViAEAVeCdo) spreadsheet) and [Alyssa Hursh](https://quip-amazon.com/VCU9EAD7HlZ)
* Add the following bookmarks to the channel:
    * The Quip spreadsheet
    * The Cohort company guide (ask [Monica Artrip](https://quip-amazon.com/QEQ9EAK646i) or [Emily Stroh](https://quip-amazon.com/JVU9EArzhYQ) for the link)
