<TK MANAGER NAME>, <TIK MENTOR NAME>:

Thank you for completing your Ada internship project plan. Based on the [Ada Internship Project Guidelines](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Ada_Developers_Academy/Intern_Program/Intern_Project_Guidelines/), I need to ask for a few revisions in order for this plan to meet the bar:

<TK SELECT FROM THIS LIST>

* This project is not a **component** or **smaller feature** of a larger project. From the SDE1 role guidelines, SDE1s work on “components or small features.” Based on this, you will need to select a new project.
* This project has been assigned to a previous intern and was not completed by that intern. You cannot re-assign a project that was already assigned once and not completed. Please assign this work to a tenured SDE on your team and select a new project for your intern.
* This project an extension of another intern's project. You cannot assign a project that builds off of the work of a previous intern. Please assign this work to a tenured SDE on your team and select a new project for your intern.
* This project involves writing tests for code that the intern will not be writing. You cannot ask an intern to write tests for code that someone else wrote. Assign writing tests to the original author of the code.
* You do not own the codebase(s) that this project involves. You cannot assign an intern to do away team work in someone else's code base. Based on this, you will need to select a new project.
* This project relies on APIs or data sources that your team does not own, and you have not assigned a tenured engineer on your team to manage the integration work. Please identify the engineer who will be responsible for this work.
* This project is written in a language or framework that your team is not familiar with. You cannot assign your intern to work in a language or framework that your team does not already use. Based on this, you will need to select a new project.
* You have not provided appropriate ramp up tasks. Please provide two to three relevant ramp up tasks for your intern to start with. Ramp up tasks can include pulling code into a Brazil workspace, setting up their IDE, and demonstrating that they know how to efficiently run unit tests and integration tests locally.
* You have not provided a design document. SDE interns do not have the experience to write design documents. Please provide a design document for this work.
* You have not provided a list of project deliverables, or your deliverables do not meet the bar. Please provide a list of deliverables. <TK - IF DELIVERABLES WERE PROVIDED, EXPLAIN WHY THEY DO NOT MEET THE BAR.>
* You have not provided a list of the first five milestones, or your milestones do not meet the bar. Please provide a list of milestones. If you need help identifying milestones, think about the exact code reviews you expect the intern to deliver. Each code review is a milestone. 
* You have not provided a list of packages that the intern will be working on. Please provide a list of packages that you expect them to modify.
* You have not identified stakeholders for this project. Please identify all stakeholders.
* <TK - ADD ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU WANT. WE MAKE THE RULES>

I will be expecting your updated plan by <TK DATE - give up to one week>. Please email me when your revised plan is complete.
