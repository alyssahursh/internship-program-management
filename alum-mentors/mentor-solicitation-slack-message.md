Hey, friends! **Cohort 16 will be joining us February 28th through July 29th, 2022**. We're getting THIRTY interns in this cohort. As always, we plan to support each of our interns with a full-time alum mentor (that's you!). 30 mentors is (again) going to require us to dig pretty deep, but I know we can do it! In terms of requirements, ideally you will have been full time at Amazon for at least six months when the cohort starts (that means you're eligible, C14). If you're ready to sign up as an alum mentor for C16, [fill out this form](https://survey.fieldsense.whs.amazon.dev/survey/8ccc6230-9168-433e-9dc5-e074a3cc14c9). 


Past mentors have cited mentoring as one of the data points that they used in their promotion to SDE2 (Hire and Develop the Best; Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer). Many have also said that mentorship helped expose them to new areas of the company, as well as new languages and tech stacks (Learn and Be Curious).

As always, you will not be alone! You will have an internship “point guard” — a long-tenured alum who will be there to help answer your questions and be a resource if things feel challenging.

If you want to chat about it first, my DMs are here for you. Pairings will be done in mid/late February right before the interns arrive. Thanks as always to everyone who has volunteered for this over the past three+ years. Your work makes a huge difference for our interns!
