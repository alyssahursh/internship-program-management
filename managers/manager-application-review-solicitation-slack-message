# Manager Application Review — Slack Message

Hey, Alums! We’re starting to review applications for C18 intern managers. For recent cohorts, we’ve used alums to score our long-form questions. We’d like to do that again for C18. I need 10 to 20 volunteers to read and score long-form questions on a scale of 0 to 3. If you want more information about the responsibility, here’s the email template we use to provide instructions for reviewers: https://quip-amazon.com/2sAwAOdVuq19/Manager-Application-Long-Form-Question-Scoring-Instruction-Email

**Dates: **** **Emails will go out on Thursday, September 29th. We’ll need your scores by Wednesday, October 5th. Each reviewer will be responsible for scoring ~75 paragraph-long answers about one question (unless you ask to sign up for more than one question). I expect the commitment to take about two hours.

**Eligibility:** All blue badge employees in this channel are eligible to participate. Please don’t overextend yourself to sign up for this.

To sign up, put your alias and cohort in this quip: https://quip-amazon.com/tPvbA7TrdwfE/C17-Manager-Application-Reviewers
