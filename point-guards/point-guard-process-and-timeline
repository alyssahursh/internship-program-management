## Solicit point guards

Send out message(s) in Slack to solicit volunteers. Example message: [Point Guard Solicitation - Slack Message](https://quip-amazon.com/ruE9AFMBe3P0)

It helps to make a list of potential point guards based on tenure and volunteer history. In general, we target SDE2+ with 3+ years at Amazon. We target 4 to 5 interns per point guard.


## Add point guards to #ada-point-guards channel

Once you have enough volunteers, add point guards to #ada-point-guards


## Make assignments in [Ada Intern Tracker — Private, Program Team Only](https://quip-amazon.com/qcRgAa3nfwCt)

[Ada Intern Tracker — Private, Program Team Only](https://quip-amazon.com/qcRgAa3nfwCt) should contain columns for Point Guard and Point Guard Alias. Unless you have good reason to do differently, assign point guards alphabetically.


## Add project plan links, languages, and tools to [Ada Intern Tracker — Private, Program Team Only](https://quip-amazon.com/qcRgAa3nfwCt)

[Ada Intern Tracker — Private, Program Team Only](https://quip-amazon.com/qcRgAa3nfwCt) should contain columns for Project Plan Link, Project Language, Project Tools, and Project Plan Status. Add links to all project plans (use @-autocomplete to quickly add plan links by intern first name).
