# Manager Selection Email - Wait List

**Subject:** Ada Hiring Manager Selection Update

**Body:**
Hi there!

Thank you so much for your application to be a Cohort 16 Ada Intern Manager. We really appreciate the time and effort you put into your application, and we are so grateful for your interest in the Ada program.

The manager application process was extremely competitive. We have mixed news for you: while you were not selected to host an intern, you have been selected for our waitlist. In the event that another manager has to drop out of the program, we will be in touch.

**If for some reason you are no longer interested in being on our wait list, please let us know immediately.**

If you have any other questions or concerns, please let me know!

Thank you,
