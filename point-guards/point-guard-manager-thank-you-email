# Point Guards - Manager Thank You

**Recipients:** Point Guards, managers

**Subject:** Thank you to our Ada Cohort 17 Point Guards

**Body:**

Hello, managers of Intern Point Guards!

In case you’re not already aware: your engineers are *incredible*. Amazon has had a relationship with [Ada Developers Academy](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/) since 2014, and we’ve been systematically strengthening our internship support programs since 2018. Starting in 2022, we began a program that we call “Intern Point Guards.” With this program, we leverage some of our most talented alumni to each provide dedicated oversight to four internships. Our Point Guards assist host teams with creating appropriate projects plans. They also attend bi-weekly progress meetings to ensure that their interns are on track, and to intervene if and when necessary.

For our most recent cohort, these Point Guards helped us accomplish something pretty incredible — 17 out of 20 of our interns met the SDE1 bar by the end of their internships. 
 
Thank you, Point Guards (and managers!), for your commitment to Hire and Develop the Best, Learn and Be Curious, and Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer. I couldn’t do this without you!
 
Cheers,
