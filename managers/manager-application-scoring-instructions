# Manager Application Long-Form Question Scoring Instruction Email

****Subject: **** ****Ada C19 Manager Application Long-Form Answer Review

****Body:****
Hi! 

Thank you for volunteering your time to review long-form answers from C19 manager applications. Attached, please find a spreadsheet of the answers to the following question:

“*TK - Replace this with the correct question text”*

* ** *
Please read and rate each question with the following scale:

* 0: Does not answer the question or is objectionable
* 1: Answers the question and is not objectionable
* 2: Meets the bar for a manager that you would consider working for
* 3: Raises the bar; you would consider changing teams to this manager based on this answer alone


If an answer is objectionable to the point that you think it deserves follow up, you can score the answer as “Concern” instead of as 0 through 3, and we may choose to follow up with the applicant’s manager to discuss their response. 

To help calibrate your scoring, here are some sample scored answers to the question “Please provide an example of a time that you supervised someone who needed additional mentorship and coaching. How did you identify those needs, and how did you provide additional support?”


* 0: “Not applicable to me”
* 1: “A person on my team was struggling to understand AWS Lambda. I pointed them to the public documentation for AWS Lambda. Once they read it, they understood AWS Lambda better.”
* 2: “A person on my team was struggling to understand AWS Lambda. I identified this struggle because they were taking longer on a task than I had expected, and I asked a series of gentle probing questions to understand more about what was going on. In order to give them time to learn, I created a learning SIM and added it our sprint. In the SIM, I provided links to an internal training that other members of my team had recently used and found helpful. I then followed up when I saw that the SIM was complete to make sure that the training was helpful and to see if the engineer needed more assistance.”
* 3: “A person on my team was struggling to understand AWS Lambda. I identified this struggle because they were taking longer on a task than I had expected, and I asked a series of gentle probing questions to understand more about what was going on. To help, I asked this person how they learn best. They said that they learn best by pairing with someone with experience in that space, and by doing hands-on practice. I paired them with the engineer on my team who is the most empathetic teacher and also has a deep understanding of AWS Lambda. I had those two engineers work together for four weeks, first with the experienced engineer driving, then with the inexperienced engineer driving. Each week, I followed up with both engineers to learn about their progress. I offered mentorship to the mentoring engineer based those follow-up conversations. After the four week pairing process, I assigned this newer engineer a similar task in the same space to help check their knowledge and solidify their learning.”
* Concern: “A person on my team was struggling with some issues in their personal life. I reminded them to focus on their job because if they lost their job they would no longer have income and would therefore have more problems in their personal life.”


Don’t worry too much about being perfectly consistent in your scoring. Each question will be read by other Ada alums and your scores will be averaged. Try not to reach for half-point scores because additional scoring gradation makes consistent scoring more mentally taxing.

Try to be aware of bias you may have in favor of native English writers or against writers for whom English is not their first language. Read answers for their content, not for their grammar or paragraph structure.

Please return your completed spreadsheet by **Monday, March 27th**. If you are unable to complete your scoring, let me know by **Thursday, March 23rd**, and I will assign the task to a back-up volunteer.

As always, let me know if you have any questions!

Thanks
