Project plans should be located in the  [Project Plans](https://quip-amazon.com/GSYYOELaBHLW) folder. Plans are also linked in the [Ada Intern Support — Public](https://quip-amazon.com/XoViAEAVeCdo) spreadsheet.


### Ada Intern Spreadsheet:

We have a [Ada Intern Support — Public](https://quip-amazon.com/XoViAEAVeCdo) Quip spreadsheet, which we use to track everything about internship.

We have a column called “Project Plan Status” to track the status of the project plans. Please use these values:

* Received
* Sent for rework - due X/Y date
* Approved
* Approved - Bar Raising
* Needs until X/Y date



### Point guard responsibility:

* Compare the project plan to the [Ada Internship Project Guidelines](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/Ada_Developers_Academy/Intern_Program/Intern_Project_Guidelines/)
    * If the plan meets your bar:
        *  Inform the manager and mentor [Point Guard Project Plan Approval - Email](https://quip-amazon.com/OWDEAtweiEKG)
        * Update [Ada Intern Support — Public](https://quip-amazon.com/XoViAEAVeCdo)with **“Approved”** under Project Plan
    * If the plan does not meet your bar:
        * Send the plan back for rework [Point Guard Project Plan Rework Required - Email](https://quip-amazon.com/GBVkAxyGaFTg)
        * Update [Ada Intern Support — Public](https://quip-amazon.com/XoViAEAVeCdo)with **“Sent for rework - due X/Y date”** under Project Plan
        * Follow up on the new date if rework is not complete [Point Guard Project Plan Follow-Up - Email](https://quip-amazon.com/LWlSAgCPcW9l)
    * If the plan significantly lowers the bar:
        * Let Alyssa know; let’s get a BR SDM involved right away
        * **Don’t be afraid to say “This is so bad, I don’t even want to deal with it.”**
* The templates are provided to make your life easier. Feel free to adjust the templates to sound like you, to provide additional feedback or insight, to provide examples of other project plans to give a sense of what you’re looking for, etc.
