# Alum Mentors - Manager Thank You

**Recipients:** Alum mentors, managers

**Subject:** Thank you to our Ada C17 Alum Mentors!

**Body:**

Hello, managers of Ada Alum Mentors!

 With the help of your engineers, we were able to provide one-on-one mentorship for all 20 SDE interns from [Ada Developers Academy](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/) Cohort 17 (H2 2023). Despite challenging conditions, our cohort was extremely successful, with 17 out of 20 interns meeting the SDE1 bar at the end of their internships. 

 Our alum mentors provide all kinds of support to our interns — technical mentorship, career coaching, help understanding how to exemplify the LPs, and more. Students at Ada regularly list Amazon as their top choice internship company because they know just how phenomenal our alumni support network is.

 Thank you, alum mentors (and managers!), for your commitment to Hire and Develop the Best, Learn and Be Curious, and Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer. We couldn’t do this without you!
