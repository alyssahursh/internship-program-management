# Point Guard Solicitation - Slack Message

Hi, everyone! 

I’m beginning preparations for our incoming C16 interns, who will start on February 28th, 2022. We will be receiving 30 interns. With this cohort, I’m hoping to introduce a new level of alumni support, in the form of something I’m calling “Intern Point Guards.” Historically, I’ve taken on these responsibilities myself, but as our cohorts have swelled in size, I’m no longer able to do all of it on my own. 

You are my most experienced and consistent alum mentors. I’m reaching out to you to see if you would be interested in helping me in this new role, in lieu of acting as direct mentors to individual interns for C16. Each “point guard” would provide oversight for 5 interns, with the following responsibilities:

* Introduce yourself and your role to your interns’ managers. We will provide a form email to facilitate this introduction.
* Introduce yourself to your interns and their alum mentors. We will provide a form email to facilitate this introduction.
* Review internship project plans provided by managers prior to the start of internship. We will provide a project review rubric as well as email templates to approve or request changes to project plans.
* Be the first person for the alum mentor to talk to about concerns. Provide mentorship advice and guidance as necessary.
* Be a second person for the intern to talk to about concerns, after they have talked to their alum mentor. Provide strategic advice and guidance as necessary.
* Review the intern survey responses that we receive from Ada and raise red flags to alum mentors, internship managers, or Ada Amazon Program Team as necessary (while keeping in mind that survey responses are intended to be confidential; this requires acting with discretion).
* Assist with escalations strategically (with assistance from me and the Ada Amazon Program Team). This can often take the form of choosing *not* to escalate, instead teaching the intern how to use a situation to demonstrate their leadership principles.
    

In my experience, about 20% of interns require additional support above and beyond what their alum mentor can provide, so I expect that on average each of you would have one intern who will require your intervention.

There are nine of us on this email; I’m hoping for six volunteers.

As always, thanks for all you do for our interns. Let me know if you have questions or concerns.
